This is a template for an academic personal homepage.

## Quick Start

If you see the following error
> `No GitHub API authentication provided...`
It is because the api of github has a limit of 60 times per hour. So, you can see this error if you refresh your page many times. The solution is to add the following code to your `_config.yml` file. And you can get your token from here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
```yml
github:
  token: "your token"
```
